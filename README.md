# Codeium Basics - lab setup

These instructions will guide you through configuring a GitHub Codespaces environment that you can use to run the course labs. Because of issues with using Codeium directly through a codespace though, we will need to use VS Code as the front end. 
If you prefer and if you know one of the other IDEs supported by Codeium, you can use that. But the instructions will reference the codespace version.

There are a lot of steps noted here for guidance. But what it boils down to is:
- Sign up for a free Codeium account
- Install VS Code if you don't have it
- Use the button further down in this readme to create a codespace
- Go to github.com/codespaces, find your new codespace in the list and tell it to open it up in VS Code
- Click through all the prompts and popups to authorize everything, open your codespace in VS Code, and get signed in

These steps **must** be completed prior to starting the actual labs.

## Step 1. Get a free Codeium account at [https://codeium.com/account/register](https://codeium.com/account/register).

Fill out the signup form.

Fill out the name form.

## Step 2. Install VS Code on your system from [this link](https://code.visualstudio.com/download) or by clicking on the icon below:

## Step 3. To create your working environment for the labs, create a codespace by clicking on the button below:

Click on this button ⬇️

<br/><br/>
Then click on the option to create a new codespace.

**This will run for several minutes while it gets everything ready.**

## Step 4. Once the codespace is running, go to [https://github.com/codespaces](https://github.com/codespaces), find your codespace in the list, click on the "..." at the end of the row and then click on "Open in Visual Studio Code".

## Step 5. In the browser pop-up, click on "Open Link" to allow the action. This will cause VS Code to open (if it isn't) and prompt you to allow opening the codespace in VS Code. In that one, just click "Open".

## Step 6. In VS Code, click to "Allow" the extension to sign in to GitHub. Then, if prompted, in the browser select the user to authorize GitHub for VS Code. Then sign-in/authorize GitHub for VS Code by clicking the "Authorize" button and click to "Open" (go back to) VS Code.

![Select user](./images/cb06.png?raw=true "Select user")
![Authorize](./images/cb07.png?raw=true "Authorize")
![Open app](./images/cb08.png?raw=true "Open app")

## Step 7. Back in VS Code, click on the "Login" button for logging into Codeium. (If you don't see a dialog with the button, click on the brown "Codeium: Login" item in the bottom bar.) Then click to "Allow" the extension to sign in, and click to "Open" the Codeium website.

![Allow sign in](./images/cb10.png?raw=true "Allow sign in")
![Open website](./images/cb11.png?raw=true "Open website")

## Step 8. In the Codeium website, if prompted to "Open Visual Studio Code.app", just click the button for that. 

![Open app](./images/cb15.png?raw=true "Open app")

## Step 9. If prompted to provide an authentication token, copy the token and then follow the instructions on the screen. (You may not be prompted to do this.)

![Provide token](./images/cb14.png?raw=true "Provide token")

Follow additional instructions on screen to provide token to VS Code.

## Step 10. If prompted again in VS Code to "Open" the URI, just select "Open".

## Step 11. Finally, at this point, you should be logged into GitHub, Codeium, and have the codespace open in VS Code.
